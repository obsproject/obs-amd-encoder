# AMD Encoder for OBS Studio

This encoder plugin is not maintained and is no longer distributed with builds of OBS Studio. This README is kept mostly as-is and may use verb tenses that are not accurate. This repository has been archived.

## Description

'obs-amd-encoder' is a plugin for [Open Broadcaster Software Studio](https://obsproject.com/) which adds support for native AMD Hardware encoding through the use of [AMDs Advanced Media Framework](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/AMF). It offers a user-friendly UI integration for the complex settings that AMD AMF offers.

This plugin is integrated in OBS Studio since Version 0.16.2. It replaced the older MFT (Media Foundation Transforms) based approach and performs much better compared to it. Many users have since then switched from software to hardware encoding on AMD machines as it is actually working at a decent performance now.

## Build Status
| Jenkins | AppVeyor |
|---------|----------|
| [![Build Status](https://ci.xaymar.com/job/Xaymar/job/obs-amd-encoder/job/master/badge/icon)](https://ci.xaymar.com/job/Xaymar/job/obs-amd-encoder/job/master/) | [![AppVeyor Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/Xaymar/obs-amd-encoder?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Xaymar/obs-amd-encoder) |

## Installation
The plugin ships with an Installer which will try to find the installation directory of OBS Studio and replaces the integrated version. You will also need the following:

* Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 or newer
* A [supported AMD GPU or APU](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-amd-encoder/wiki/Hardware-Support)
* [Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 Redistributables](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) (32-bit and 64-bit)
* Latest [AMD Graphics Driver](https://support.amd.com/en-us/download)
* Latest [Open Broadcaster Software Studio](https://obsproject.com/)
